        <p>One of the courses I took during my bachelor in Media Technology was Sensor Programming (DM1588). In the course we learned how to use sensors and actuators together with Arduino.</p>
        <p>The end project, How to save a life, was made in two groups that collaborated. Frida Jansson and I made an Ambulance Simulation, while Hanna Almqvist and Hanna Snarberg made Interactive CPR.</p>
        <p>While making the Ambulance simulation I learned the basics of programming in C++ and Java, for Arduino respectivly Processing, skills that I have later developed further. I also learned how to desing and create an interactive experience using sensors and actuators, in addition to wiring said sansors and actuators to the Arduino. Lastly, I got introduced to material knowledge, and how different material's attributes can be used for different purposes.</p>
