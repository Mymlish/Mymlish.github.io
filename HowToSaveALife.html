        <p>One of the courses I took during my bachelor in Media Technology was Sensor Programming (DM1588). In the course we learned how to use sensors and actuators together with Arduino. The end project, How to save a life, was made in two groups that collaborated. Frida Jansson and I made an Ambulance Simulation, while Hanna Almqvist and Hanna Snarberg made Interactive CPR. While making the Ambulance simulation I learned the basics of programming in C++ and Java, for Arduino respectivly Processing, skills that I have later developed further. I also learned how to desing and create an interactive experience using sensors and actuators, in addition to wiring said sansors and actuators to the Arduino. Lastly, I got introduced to material knowledge, and how different material's attributes can be used for different purposes.</p>
        <p>Following below is a video demonstration of the Ambulance Simulation and its communication with the Interactive CPR.</p>
