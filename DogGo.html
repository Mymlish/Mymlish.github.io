        <h1>DogGo</h1>  
        <p>One of the courses here at KTH was Media Technology and Interaction Design (DM2609). In this course we learned about different methods in all stages of a design process, which was applied to a project.</p>
        <p>Through this project DogGo was born. A mobile app designed for petowners, where they can connect with other petowners, plan hangouts for their pets, and let other petowners know whether they have time for a playdate or not.</p>
        <p>The project was created in collaboration with Maria Zelenika, Dominika Grossov√° and Alicia Kurimska over a timeperiod of approximately 6 weeks. During this time I did not only learn about the design process, nut I also learned to prototype in Figma.</p>
